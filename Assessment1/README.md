The distribution of the this particular graph is decidedly not symmetrical due to the lack of symmetry lines. Also, this presents a unique perspective as all of the graphs would be unique due to the random nature of how it's made. The mean for this graph is 49.246 whereas the median for this group is 49 which almost identical to the mean. this could be due to the max number being 100, however upon further reflection a max number of 10**6 also gives similar values. I have also noticed the graph is slightly skewed in favor of the lower and higher end of the numbers. This has affected the normal distribution completely as it is the total opposite of the Histograms readings distribution line .

## Task 5

Over the course of the two semesters, you should have developed technical and practical skills, and you should have used Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and other technical and practical programming tools
as part of the COM4043 module as well as other modules in the programme.

Reflect on a range of technical issues consisting of installations, setting up accounts, configuring compilers and IDEs, identifying errors, and debugging.
Write 300 - 400 words covering:

1. What tasks you found easiest or hardest (and why).
2. Give an example of a technical issues (related to programming) that you faced, and describe the steps you took to resolve the issue.
3. How you overcame any challenges (YouTube tutorials? Class notes? Asking peers?).
4. One skill you want to improve (e.g., debugging, data visualization).
